# vcv-rack-sdk

⚠️ Do not clone this repository or add it as a submodule. We could modify it whenever we see fit ⚠️

This repository is a mirror of the [VCV Rack SDK](https://vcvrack.com/downloads/).

It is meant only to be used as a dependency for the
[`eurorack-blocks`](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks) project.

This repository is not the official VCV Rack SDK repository. It exists only because VCV
Rack doesn't provide a repository for their SDK, and including it as a submodule of the
[`eurorack-blocks`](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks) project simplifies
installation and automations.

Always refer to the official source. This repository is currently using
[version 1.1.6](https://vcvrack.com/downloads/Rack-SDK-1.1.6.zip) of the VCV Rack SDK.
